# Database migrations

These files are **not** applied automatically. There is no Supabase CLI
pipeline in this repo. Run them yourself in the Supabase SQL editor
(Dashboard → SQL → New query), against the project Helixa uses.

Run order is the filename timestamp. Phase 2 stacks on phase 1. Run:

1. `20260930_phase1_rls_realtime.sql`
2. `20260930_phase2_workspaces_and_events.sql`

Phase 2 adds workspaces (owner, admin, member, client-viewer), tags existing
accounts onto a default workspace, and adds the `inbound_events` queue the
webhook worker drains. It does not delete rows. A person who belongs to more
than one agency gets a membership per workspace and can switch; the app no
longer opens the oldest seat automatically.

That script:

1. Enables row-level security on the core tables and adds per-owner policies.
   A logged-in user can read their own rows. An accepted team member
   (`agency_team_members.status = 'active'`) can read the agency's rows.
   Admins (`accounts.role = 'admin'`) can read them too. Everyone else,
   including the public anon key, is denied.
2. Removes `users`, `platform_connections`, `oauth_sessions`,
   `account_agent_settings`, and `dm_queue` from the `supabase_realtime`
   publication. Those tables hold access tokens or encrypted keys. Realtime
   payloads include every column, so they must not be broadcast.
3. Revokes `SELECT` on `users.access_token`,
   `platform_connections.access_token`, and the BYOK key column from the
   `anon` and `authenticated` roles.
4. Adds `users.reconnect_required` and `users.token_refreshed_at` for the
   Instagram token refresh job.

The Next.js server uses the service-role key, which bypasses RLS. Webhooks
and API routes keep working. Do not run this from an app process, and do not
run it against a database you have not backed up.

After it succeeds:

- Supabase → Database → Advisors. Confirm RLS is on for `users`, `messages`,
  `conversations`, `automations`, and `platform_connections`.
- Delete any hand-written policy that uses `USING (true)` on those tables.
  This script does not drop unknown policies, and permissive policies are
  combined with OR.
- Do **not** re-run `scripts/99-fix-realtime.sql`. That script adds `users`
  back to the realtime publication.

The older files in this folder and the scripts in `scripts/` were applied by
hand before this README existed. They are not a complete history of the live
schema.

## Phase 2 manual steps

Run `20260930_phase2_workspaces_and_events.sql` after the phase 1 file. It is
idempotent. It does not delete tenant rows.

Environment:

- `CRON_SECRET` must be set. Vercel Cron sends it as a bearer token. The new
  drain route fails closed without it, same as the other cron routes.
- Optional: `INBOUND_RATE_LIMIT` (default 30) and `INBOUND_RATE_WINDOW_MS`
  (default 60000). That is the per-account cap on events a worker will
  process inside one window. Over the cap, the event stays pending and is
  tried again after the window. It does not count as a failure.

Cron:

- `vercel.json` schedules `GET /api/cron/process-inbound-events` every minute.
  Vercel Hobby only allows daily crons, so this schedule needs Pro (or an
  external cron calling that path with `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`).
- Webhooks also call the drain after the response via Next.js `after()`, so
  a delivery is processed without waiting for the minute tick. The cron is
  what retries failures and rate-limit defers.
- If `inbound_events` does not exist yet, the webhook processes that delivery
  in the request and still returns 200. Run the SQL before relying on retries.

Queue choice: a Supabase table, not a new vendor. The app is already on
Vercel plus Supabase, and there is no Redis or queue product in the project.
`inbound_events.idempotency_key` is unique, `claim_inbound_events` uses
`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, and failed rows wait on exponential backoff
(15s, 30s, 60s, … capped at 15 minutes) until 5 attempts, then `dead`.

After it succeeds, confirm in the SQL editor:

```sql
select count(*) from public.workspaces;
select count(*) from public.workspace_members where role = 'owner';
select indexname from pg_indexes where tablename = 'inbound_events';
```

The owner count should match the number of accounts that existed before the
script. `inbound_events` should have a unique index on `idempotency_key`.

## Phase 3 manual steps

Run `20260930_phase3_contacts_and_clicks.sql` after phase 2. It is idempotent.
It does not delete rows. It was not run against a live database from this change.

The script:

1. Adds `messages.direction` (`in` or `out`) and backfills it. A message whose
   sender is the conversation's recipient is inbound. That corrects Messenger
   and Telegram rows that were stored with `is_from_instagram = false` for
   both directions.
2. Creates `contacts` (one person per channel in a workspace): tags, custom
   fields, source, first/last seen, `last_inbound_at`, and `bot_paused`.
3. Creates `tracked_links`. `GET /r/{code}` redirects to the stored https URL
   and inserts `automation_events.event_type = 'link_click'`.
4. Enables row-level security on both new tables. The service role used by
   the app bypasses it. Authenticated users can read their workspace's rows.
   They cannot insert from the browser.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` must be the public origin. Outbound button and text
links are rewritten to `{origin}/r/{code}` only when that variable is set.
Without it, messages still send the original URL and link clicks stay at
zero.

The 24-hour window is computed from `contacts.last_inbound_at`, then from the
latest inbound message if the contact row does not exist yet. Instagram and
Messenger sends outside 24 hours and inside 7 days go out with Meta's
`HUMAN_AGENT` tag and the inbox shows that. WhatsApp sends outside 24 hours
are blocked (template messages are not in this phase). Telegram has no window.

Confirm after it succeeds:

```sql
select column_name from information_schema.columns
 where table_name = 'messages' and column_name = 'direction';
select count(*) from public.contacts;
select indexname from pg_indexes where tablename = 'tracked_links';
```

## Phase 4 manual steps

Run `20260930_phase4_channels.sql` after phase 3. It is idempotent. It does
not delete rows. It was not run against a live database from this change.

The script:

1. Adds `conversations.channel_account_id` and `conversations.external_thread_id`
   so a manual reply uses the WhatsApp number, TikTok account, or widget that
   received the thread. Replaces `UNIQUE (user_id, recipient_id)` with a
   unique index that includes platform and channel account. If duplicate
   threads already exist, that index is skipped and a notice is raised.
2. Adds `platform_connections.refresh_token` and `token_expires_at`, and
   revokes `SELECT` on `refresh_token` from `anon` and `authenticated`.
3. Allows `tiktok` and `webchat` on `platform_connections.platform` and
   `inbound_events.platform`.
4. Creates `whatsapp_templates`, `webchat_widgets`, `webchat_visitors`, and
   `webchat_rate_buckets`. Authenticated users can read their own widgets and
   templates. Visitor secret hashes and rate buckets have no read policy.

Meta, for WhatsApp:

- Add the WhatsApp product to the same Meta app Helixa already uses.
- Create an Embedded Signup configuration and set
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_CONFIG_ID` to its id. Without that id, the dashboard
  still connects a number with a phone number id and a system-user token.
  The number must already be registered in WhatsApp Manager. This app does
  not call `/{phone-number-id}/register`.
- System-user token scopes: `whatsapp_business_messaging` and
  `whatsapp_business_management`.
- Webhook callback `{APP_URL}/api/whatsapp/webhook`, verify token
  `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`, subscribed field `messages`.
- App id and secret: `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_APP_ID` or
  `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID`, and `META_APP_SECRET` or `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` or
  `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET`.

TikTok, after approval (see `docs/phase4-channels.md`):

- `TIKTOK_APP_ID`, `TIKTOK_APP_SECRET`
- `TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI` defaults to `{NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/tiktok/callback`
- `TIKTOK_MESSAGING_ENABLED=true` only after Business Messaging approval
- `TIKTOK_COMMENT_TO_DM_ENABLED=true` only where Comment-to-Message is available
- Webhook `{APP_URL}/api/tiktok/webhook` is subscribed on connect
- `CRON_SECRET` for `GET /api/cron/refresh-tiktok-tokens` (hourly)

Website chat needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` so the copied snippet points at this
app. An empty allowed-domain list denies every site.

Confirm after it succeeds:

```sql
select column_name from information_schema.columns
 where table_name = 'conversations' and column_name = 'channel_account_id';
select conname from pg_constraint
 where conname in ('inbound_events_platform_check', 'platform_connections_platform_check');
select count(*) from public.webchat_widgets;
```

## Phase 5 manual steps

Run `20260930_phase5_flows_broadcasts.sql` after phase 4. It is idempotent.
It does not delete rows. It was not run against a live database from this
change. Do not run it from the app.

The script:

1. Adds `contacts.opted_in`, `contacts.opted_out`, and `contacts.is_follower`.
   Existing contacts stay opted out of broadcasts until something sets
   `opted_in`. Flow replies inside an open window do not require that flag.
2. Adds `tracked_links.broadcast_id` so `/r/{code}` can mark a broadcast click.
   If the column is missing, link tracking still redirects and skips the
   broadcast update.
3. Creates `flows`, `flow_versions`, `flow_runs`, `flow_jobs`,
   `flow_node_stats`, `broadcasts`, `broadcast_recipients`, `sequences`,
   `sequence_enrollments`, `bio_pages`, `ref_links`, `giveaways`, and
   `giveaway_entries`.
4. Adds `claim_flow_jobs` and `bump_flow_node_stat`, executable by
   `service_role` only.
5. Enables row-level security. Authenticated users can read their workspace's
   rows. `flow_jobs` has no read policy. The service role bypasses RLS.

The existing cron `GET /api/cron/process-inbound-events` also drains
`flow_jobs` (delays, button resumes, broadcasts, sequence steps). No new cron
path is required. `CRON_SECRET` stays required.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is the origin for `/b/{slug}`, ref-link QR targets that
point back at Helixa, and tracked broadcast links. Without it, public pages
still work at whatever host is serving the app, and outbound links stay
untracked.

`TIKTOK_MESSAGING_ENABLED=true` is still required before a TikTok DM trigger
matches. Leave it unset until Business Messaging is approved.

WhatsApp templates still sync the way phase 4 documents. A broadcast or a
flow step outside 24 hours sends only a template whose row is `approved`,
and only to a contact with `opted_in = true`.

After the SQL succeeds, open Flows and use Import automations. That publishes
each active single-step rule as a live flow. Until that import, the old
automations keep sending. After it, the live flow replaces that send so the
contact does not get two replies.

Confirm after it succeeds:

```sql
select column_name from information_schema.columns
 where table_name = 'contacts' and column_name in ('opted_in', 'opted_out', 'is_follower');
select proname from pg_proc where proname in ('claim_flow_jobs', 'bump_flow_node_stat');
select count(*) from public.flows;
```

## Phase 6

Run `20260930_phase6_differentiators.sql` after phase 5. Enable the `vector`
extension in the Supabase dashboard first if `CREATE EXTENSION` is restricted.
The file adds the Arabic agent tables (`ai_agent_settings`, `knowledge_sources`,
`knowledge_chunks`, `ai_answer_logs`), agency branding and client reports,
the product catalog and orders, and outgoing webhook deliveries. It does not
delete rows. Details and the Vercel custom-domain steps are in
`docs/phase6-differentiators.md`.

The inbound cron also drains `outgoing_webhook_deliveries`. Client reports use
a separate daily cron, `GET /api/cron/client-reports`.

## Phase 7

Run `20260930_phase7_launch.sql` after phase 6. It adds plan billing, usage
meters, agency client prices and invoices, Meta deletion receipts, and
`bot_locale` on `users` and `accounts`. It does not delete rows.
`increment_usage` is executable by `service_role` only.
`data_deletion_requests` is revoked from `anon` and `authenticated`.

The new cron is `GET /api/cron/dunning` at 04:00 UTC. Full setup, including
every environment variable and the Meta callback URLs, is in `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
